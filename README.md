# Primer ID Template Consensus Sequence (TCS) Pipeline
RUBY Script to creat Primer ID tempalate consensus from raw MiSeq fastq files

#Version 1.33-19FEB2016

	1. 1. consensus cut-off model based on 3 levels of error rate (0.02, 0.01, 0.005). By default 0.02. 


#Version 1.32-24JAN2016

	1. Adapted to TCS website
	2. Compress output directory in .tar.gz file


#Version 1.31-14NOV2016
Patch Notes

	1. ADDING PRIMER ID FILTER AFTER CONCENSUS CREATION
        	1. Compare PID with sequences which have identical sequences.
        	2. PIDs differ by 1 base will be recognized. If PID1 is x time greater than PID2, PID2 will be disgarded
        	3. PID factor x is 10 by default.
       		4. PID filter only apply when the number of potential consensus sequences is less than 0.3% of the maximum capacity of PID. 

#Version 1.30-23SEP2016
Patch Notes:

    1.Add Primer ID filter after consensus creation. Compare PID with sequences which have identical sequences. PIDs differ by 1 base will be recognized. If PID1 is x time greater than PID2, PID2 will be disgarded. PID factor x is 10 by default. 

#Version 1.21-18JUL2016
Patch Notes:

    1.Allow ambituities of bases in the gene specific sequences. 

#Version 1.20-05JUN2016
Patch Notes:

    1.Now allow multiplexed Primer ID sequencing system. Input primers in pairs for all sets.
    
    2.Add option to ignore the 1st nucleotide of the Primer ID. 

Create Primer ID template consensus sequences from raw MiSeq FASTq file

Input = directory of raw sequences of two ends (R1 and R2 fasta files)

Require parameters:

    list of Primer Sequence of cDNA primer and 1st round PCR forward Primer, including a tag for the pair name
    
    ignore the first nucleotide of Primer ID: Yes/No (default: Yes)



#Version 1.11-24FEB2016
Patch Notes:

    1. consensus cut-off calculation using average number of top 5 abundant Primer ID
    2. Add 'resampling indicator' = consensus without ambuiguities / all consensus including ambuiguities.

Create Primer ID template consensus sequences from raw MiSeq FASTq file

Input = directory of raw sequences of two ends (R1 and R2 fasta files)

Require parameters:

    Length of Primer ID
  
    Primer Sequence of cDNA primer and 1st round PCR forward Primer


#Version 1.10-09302015
